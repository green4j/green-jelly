/**
 * This interface presents a container of a string value the parser has parsed.
 * An instance of this container will be passed to
 * {@link JsonEventListener#onObjectMember(CharSequence)} or
 * {@link JsonEventListener#onStringValue(CharSequence)}.
 * Different implementations of the container may use specific optimizations.
 * For example:
 * 1. You parse a CharSequence, which contains the whole message. Then you could
 * use the Flyweight pattern to store a reference to the buffer and start
 * position of the value and its length. See {@link FlyweightStringBuilder}.
 * 2. When you parse a message part by part, you have to collect all chars of
 * current string value to prevent its corruption. This means
 * {@link CopyingStringBuilder} can be used.
 * 3. If you need to have the JSON values be unescaped, a copying builder should
 * be used instead of a flyweight one, since the length of the result string may
 * be different, less than original string's length. To unescape JSON values you
 * can use {@link CopyingStringBuilder#CopyingStringBuilder(boolean)} with true passed (default value).
 * @see FlyweightStringBuilder
